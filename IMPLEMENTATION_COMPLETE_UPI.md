```

## 🔧 Setup Required (3 Steps)

### 1. Update Environment Variables

Edit `website/server/.env`:
```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@gmail.com
UPI_ID=your-upi@paytm
```

### 2. Add UPI QR Codes

Create 3 PNG files in `website/public/qr-codes/`:
- `starter.png` - QR for ₹400
- `pro.png` - QR for ₹1000
- `enterprise.png` - QR for ₹1500

**How to generate:**
- Use PhonePe/GPay/Paytm "Request Money"
- Or: https://www.qrcodechimp.com/upi-qr-code-generator

### 3. Reset Database

```cmd
cd website\server
del snappy.db
node index.js
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```cmd
REM Terminal 1 - Backend
cd website\server
node index.js

REM Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd website
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. **Users:** Go to http://localhost:3000/pricing
2. **Admin:** Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/payments

## 📧 Email Triggers (Two-Step Process)

### Email 1: Welcome Email (Automatic)
- ✅ Sent when user registers
- ✅ Automatic (no action needed)

### Email 2: License Key (Manual - Two Steps)
- ⏸️ **Step 1:** User submits payment → NO EMAIL
- ⏸️ **Step 2:** You verify payment → STILL NO EMAIL
- ✅ **Step 3:** You click "Send License Email" → EMAIL SENT!

**This gives you full control!**

## 🎨 Admin Panel Features

### Two Tabs:

**Tab 1: Pending Verification**

3. 📧 **Send License Email** - Trigger license email
4. 🔄 **Refresh** - Reload pending payments
